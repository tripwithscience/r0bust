this is a simple code to obtain ips from a p2p connection.
only works with google chrome
press F12 to access the developer tools in browser, head over to console
type clear and hit enter 
open your site say omegle.com,paste the code on the console of developer tool
hit enter and boom you will now see a bunch of ip addresses flying around
GOOD LUCK!! THINK BAD DO GOOD.
